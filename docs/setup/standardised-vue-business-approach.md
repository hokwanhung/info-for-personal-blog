# Standardized Vue.js Approach for Businesses in 2024

As of 2024, businesses have largely standardized around Vue 3 with its Composition API as the preferred approach. Here's the current industry standard setup:

## Core Stack

1. **Vue 3** (now at version 3.4+)
   - Composition API as the default (Options API still available for migration)
   - `<script setup>` syntax for SFCs (Single File Components)

2. **Build Tool**: Vite (replaced Vue CLI as the standard)
   - Faster builds and HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
   - Built-in support for modern web features

3. **State Management**: Pinia (replaced Vuex)
   - Simpler API
   - Better TypeScript support
   - Modular by design

## Common Project Structure

```
project/
├── src/
│   ├── assets/          # Static assets
│   ├── components/      # Reusable components
│   ├── composables/     # Composition functions
│   ├── stores/          # Pinia stores
│   ├── router/          # Vue Router configuration
│   ├── views/           # Page-level components
│   ├── services/        # API/services layer
│   ├── utils/           # Utility functions
│   ├── App.vue          # Root component
│   └── main.js          # App entry point
├── public/              # Static public files
├── tests/               # Test files
├── vite.config.js       # Vite configuration
└── package.json
```

## Essential Packages

1. **Routing**: Vue Router 4.x
2. **UI Libraries** (common choices):
   - PrimeVue
   - Vuetify (Vue 3 compatible version)
   - Quasar Framework
   - Element Plus
   - Naive UI
3. **HTTP Client**: Axios or VueUse's useFetch
4. **Utility**: VueUse (collection of essential Composition API utilities)
5. **Testing**:
   - Vitest (unit testing)
   - Cypress or Playwright (E2E testing)
6. **TypeScript**: Widely adopted for larger projects
7. **SSR**: Nuxt.js (if SSR/SSG needed) - now at Nuxt 3

## Additional Considerations

- **Performance**: Automatic component lazy loading with Vite
- **Security**: Built-in XSS protection in Vue 3 templates
- **DevTools**: Vue DevTools 7.x with Composition API support
- **IDE Support**: Volar extension for VS Code (replaced Vetur)

This setup provides a good balance between developer experience, performance, and maintainability for business applications.
