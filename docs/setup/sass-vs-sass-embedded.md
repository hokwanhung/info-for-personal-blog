Here's a clear breakdown of **Sass** (the `sass` npm package) vs. **Sass Embedded** (`sass-embedded`), along with recommendations for when to use each:

---

### **Key Differences**

| Feature               | `sass` (Dart Sass)                     | `sass-embedded`                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Implementation**    | Pure JavaScript compilation            | Embeds Dart Sass VM via JS wrapper         |
| **Performance**       | Good for most projects                 | **2-3x faster** for large codebases        |
| **Installation Size** | ~7MB (JavaScript-only)                 | ~25MB (includes Dart VM binaries)          |
| **Cold Starts**       | Slower (needs to bootstrap JS engine)  | Faster (Dart VM stays warm between runs)   |
| **CI/CD Performance** | Adequate                               | **Best for CI** (reuses VM between builds) |
| **Platform Support**  | Works everywhere Node.js runs          | Requires platform-specific Dart binaries   |
| **Compatibility**     | Official Sass reference implementation | Same features as Dart Sass                 |

### **When to Use `sass` (Standard Package)**
✅ **Choose `sass` if**:
- You're working on a **small-to-medium project**
- Need **universal platform support** (no native binary requirements)
- Want the **smallest possible dependency size**
- Using **simple build chains** (Vite, Webpack, etc.)
- Don't want to manage native binaries

---

### **When to Use `sass-embedded`**
✅ **Choose `sass-embedded` if**:
- You have **10,000+ lines of Sass** (enterprise-scale projects)
- Need **fast CI/CD builds** (especially in Docker environments)
- Work with **monorepos** or **design systems**
- Use **Sass in watch mode** (hot reloading)
- Can tolerate larger installation size (~25MB)

---

### **Performance Benchmarks**
| Scenario                 | `sass` (JS) | `sass-embedded` |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | --------------- |
| Cold Start (1 file)      | 500ms       | 400ms           |
| Warm Start (100 files)   | 1200ms      | 400ms           |
| CI Pipeline (1000 files) | 8s          | 2.5s            |

---

### **Recommendation for 2024**
**For Most Projects**:  
✅ **Use `sass`**  
- The standard choice for 95% of projects
- Works seamlessly with all build tools
- No native binary hassles

**For Enterprise/CI-Critical Projects**:  
✅ **Use `sass-embedded`**  
- If you have large Sass codebases (>10k lines)
- If CI pipeline speed is critical
- If you're using design systems like Storybook

---

### **Migration Example**
```bash
# Switch from sass to sass-embedded
npm uninstall sass
npm install sass-embedded
```

Most build tools (Vite, Webpack, etc.) will automatically detect `sass-embedded` without config changes.

---

### **Important Notes**
1. Both packages are **actively maintained** by the Sass core team
2. `sass-embedded` uses the **exact same Dart Sass compiler** as the JS package
3. The **API is identical** between both packages
4. **Vite 5+** automatically prefers `sass-embedded` if installed

---

**Final Verdict**: Start with `sass` for simplicity. Switch to `sass-embedded` only if you hit performance bottlenecks or work with enterprise-scale Sass codebases. The speed gains aren't noticeable for small projects, but become dramatic at scale.
