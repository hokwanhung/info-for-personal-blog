Here's a comprehensive breakdown of **oxlint** and whether you should consider adopting it:

---

### **What is oxlint?**
**oxlint** is a new **Rust-based JavaScript/TypeScript linter** created by the team behind the [Oxc Project](https://oxc-project.github.io/) (Oxidation Compiler). It's designed as a **blazing-fast alternative to ESLint**, leveraging Rust's performance to deliver:

- ‚ö° **10-100x faster** linting than ESLint
- ü¶Ä Built with Rust (same tech stack as tools like SWC/Rome)
- üîã **Battery-included** with 200+ built-in rules
- üß© Partial ESLint compatibility (supports `.eslintrc` configs)
- üîç Focus on **correctness** and **performance**

### **Key Differences vs ESLint**

| Feature             | oxlint                       | ESLint                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Speed**           | 10-100x faster               | Standard speed        |
| **Architecture**    | Rust-native                  | JavaScript            |
| **Plugin System**   | ‚ùå No custom plugins          | ‚úÖ Extensive plugins   |
| **Config Support**  | Partial ESLint compatibility | Full ESLint ecosystem |
| **Rule Coverage**   | 200+ core rules (growing)    | 1000+ via plugins     |
| **TypeScript**      | ‚úÖ Built-in support           | ‚úÖ Via plugins         |
| **Custom Rules**    | ‚ùå Not supported              | ‚úÖ Fully customizable  |
| **IDE Integration** | Early stage                  | Mature                |

### **When to Use oxlint? ‚úÖ**

1. **Large Codebases**  
   Ideal for monorepos/enterprise projects where ESLint becomes slow

2. **CI/CD Pipelines**  
   Significantly reduces linting time in PR checks (seconds vs minutes)

3. **New Projects**  
   Great if you don't need ESLint plugins

4. **Performance-Critical Workflows**  
   Developers saving 5-10 seconds per file save adds up

5. **ESLint-Compatible Configs**  
   Works with existing `.eslintrc.js` files (partial support)

---

### **When to Stick with ESLint? ‚ö†Ô∏è**

1. **Legacy Projects**  
   If you rely heavily on ESLint plugins (`eslint-plugin-import`, etc.)

2. **Custom Rules**  
   Need to write project-specific lint rules

3. **Full Ecosystem**  
   Require integrations like `eslint-plugin-vue`/`eslint-plugin-react`

4. **Strict Compatibility**  
   oxlint isn't 100% ESLint-compatible yet

---

### **oxlint's Current Limitations**

1. **No Plugin System**  
   Can't extend with community rules

2. **Early Adoption Phase**  
   Less battle-tested than ESLint

3. **Partial Config Support**  
   Some ESLint options are ignored

4. **Limited Framework Support**  
   No Vue/React/Angular specific rules yet

---

### **Recommendation for 2024**

**Use oxlint if**:  
- You want **raw speed** for basic linting  
- Your project uses **vanilla JS/TS** without framework-specific needs  
- You're starting a **new project**  

**Stick with ESLint if**:  
- You need **Vue/React** specific rules  
- You rely on **plugins** like `import/order`  
- You require **custom rules**  

---

### **How to Try oxlint**

1. Install:
   ```bash
   npm install oxlint --save-dev
   ```

2. Run:
   ```bash
   npx oxlint@latest
   ```

3. Use with ESLint config:
   ```bash
   npx oxlint@latest --config .eslintrc.json
   ```

---

### **The Future Outlook**
While oxlint isn't ready to fully replace ESLint yet, it represents an important shift toward **Rust-based tooling** in the JS ecosystem. For teams prioritizing performance over ecosystem maturity, it's worth exploring as a **supplemental linter**:

```bash
# Sample workflow: Fast feedback first, then detailed checks
npx oxlint && eslint . # Run oxlint first for quick feedback
```

--- 

**Final Verdict**: oxlint is **promising for performance-critical scenarios** but not yet a full ESLint replacement. Consider using it alongside ESLint in large projects where speed matters, but keep ESLint for comprehensive checks.
