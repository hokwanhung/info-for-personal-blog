The suggested PR checks workflow is excellent and well-structured. Let me help you implement this while considering your current setup.

1. First, let's delete the Firebase PR deployment workflow:
```bash
rm .github/workflows/firebase-hosting-pull-request.yml
```

2. Create a new PR checks workflow:

```yaml:.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml
name: PR Quality Checks
on: pull_request

jobs:
  # Code Style & Consistency
  lint_and_format:
    name: "Lint & Format"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Adjust based on your .nvmrc/package.json
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      # ESLint check
      - name: Run ESLint
        run: npm run lint
      
      # Prettier check (without modifying files)
      - name: Check Prettier formatting
        run: npm run format:check

  # Testing & Type Safety
  test_and_types:
    name: "Test & Type Check"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      # TypeScript validation
      - name: Type check
        run: npm run typecheck
      
      # Unit tests (if you have them)
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm run test:ci

  # Build Verification
  build:
    name: "Production Build"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      # Verify production build
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
      
      # Bundle size monitoring
      - uses: preactjs/compressed-size-action@v3
        with:
          pattern: 'dist/**/*.{js,css,html}'
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          minimum-change-threshold: 100 # Only alert if bundle size changes by >100 bytes

  # Security Checks (Optional but recommended)
  security:
    name: "Security Audit"
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'
      
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      # NPM vulnerability check
      - name: NPM audit
        run: npm audit --audit-level=moderate || true # Don't fail PR on audit issues
```

3. Update your `package.json` to include the necessary scripts:

```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    // ... existing scripts ...
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .vue,.js,.jsx,.cjs,.mjs,.ts,.tsx,.cts,.mts --fix --ignore-path .gitignore",
    "format": "prettier --write \"**/*.{js,ts,vue,json,css,scss,md}\"",
    "format:check": "prettier --check \"**/*.{js,ts,vue,json,css,scss,md}\"",
    "typecheck": "vue-tsc --noEmit",
    "test:ci": "vitest run", // If you have tests
    "build": "vue-tsc && vite build" // Your existing build command
  }
}
```

4. Set up branch protection rules in GitHub:
   1. Go to your repository settings
   2. Navigate to "Branches"
   3. Add rule for your main branch:
   ```
   Branch name pattern: main
   ✓ Require status checks to pass before merging
   ✓ Require branches to be up to date before merging
   Select status checks:
   - lint_and_format
   - test_and_types
   - build
   - security (optional)
   ```

Key differences from the DeepSeek suggestion:

1. **Simplified Security Checks**: 
   - Removed Snyk integration since it requires additional setup and token
   - Kept npm audit but made it non-blocking (`|| true`)
   - You can add Snyk later if needed

2. **Improved Node.js Setup**:
   - Added proper Node.js setup with caching
   - Uses `actions/setup-node@v4` for better performance

3. **Better Script Organization**:
   - Separated format checking from formatting
   - Added specific test:ci script for CI environment
   - Included Vue-specific type checking

4. **Bundle Size Monitoring**:
   - Added threshold to prevent noise from minor changes
   - Specifically targets your Vue build output

To implement this:

1. Save the YAML as `.github/workflows/pr-checks.yml`
2. Update your `package.json` with the new scripts
3. Set up branch protection rules
4. Test by creating a PR

Optional Enhancements:
1. Add Snyk later if you need deeper security scanning
2. Add test coverage reporting if you implement tests
3. Consider adding E2E tests with Playwright in CI
4. Add dependency update automation with Renovate or Dependabot

This setup provides a solid foundation for PR quality checks while being simpler to maintain than the full DeepSeek suggestion.
