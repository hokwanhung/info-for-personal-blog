Here are my **2024 recommendations for domain registrars** (post-Google Domains), focusing on **security, pricing transparency**, and **user experience**:

### **Specialized Options**
- **Vercel/Netlify**: Developers hosting static sites (JAMstack)  
- **AWS Route 53**: Enterprise users needing advanced DNS  
- **Dynadot**: Bulk domain buyers  
- **Gandi.net**: Ethically-minded users (supports open source)

### **Key Factors to Consider**
1. **Pricing Transparency**  
   Avoid registrars with hidden renewal spikes (e.g., GoDaddy’s $0.99 first year → $24.99 renewal).

2. **Free WHOIS Privacy**  
   Essential to prevent spam (Porkbun/Cloudflare include it for free).

3. **TLD Support**  
   Need .blog/.dev/.io? Check if the registrar supports your extension.

4. **DNS Management**  
   Cloudflare offers the most robust free DNS with DDoS protection.

5. **Transfer Policies**  
   Avoid registrars that lock domains (Squarespace allows easy transfers out).

### **Recommended Workflow**
1. **Register with Porkbun/Cloudflare** for best pricing  
2. **Use Cloudflare DNS** (free) for security/performance  
3. **Enable 2FA** on your registrar account

### **Migrating from Google Domains**
Squarespace is the official migration path, but you’re **not obligated** to stay with them. Transfer to another registrar using these steps:  
1. Unlock domain in Google Domains  
2. Request transfer authorization code  
3. Initiate transfer at new registrar (Porkbun/Cloudflare recommended)

**My Personal Pick**: **Cloudflare** for domains + **Vercel** for hosting (if technical) or **Porkbun** for simplicity. Avoid upselling giants like GoDaddy/Bluehost unless you want constant "web hosting" spam.
